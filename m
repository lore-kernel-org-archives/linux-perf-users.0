How would you interpret reserved_host_counters=0? Because that would
express that the host should have zero counters and the guest gets them
all. I remember in early versions of this series last year I did use 0
as the default but reviewers asked for a way to express the scenario of
of zero counters for the host.

It is fiddly, which is why the more I think about it the more I'd rather
ditch the kernel cmdline entirely and leave it up to KVM. That's the
most flexible approach. There isn't a good way to change the cmdline
after boot. Trying to make it writeable via sysfs runs into the problem
of when is it safe to apply the change.

I thought it was commonly understood module parameters need to be
prefixed by the module name, but I can add better documentation to that
effect.

I'll attempt to reproduce that. I've never seen it myself but I've
mainly been using QEMU for my testing.

I'll investigate but I'm not sure perf is intended to guarantee
that. perf stat just runs the event counters but may not write or read
them at exactly the same time.

HPME only has any effect while HPMN is programmed to a value different
than the number of counters on the system. That is only true in a guest
context. As I understand it, that means HPME has no effect anywhere the
host driver needs to freeze counters since that happens in host context.

Maybe HPMN stays programmed during interrupt handling though. I'll
confirm.

KVM selftests definitely don't catch it. I'll see if I can reproduce.

Since the problem happens with 2 CPUs I wonder if something is
triggering the lazy context swap behavior so the counter values aren't
being moved to the 2nd CPU correctly.

Maybe. I'll check. The guest is also running its own PMU driver that
might trigger guest ownership on initialization since ownership is
determined by which registers the guest touches.

I've looked at these and concluded they are worth fixing.
