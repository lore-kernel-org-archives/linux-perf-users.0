Hello Akinobu,

As I also commented to the previous version, the high level idea makes sense to
me.  I think this can be useful.

Also as I commented to the previous version, I understand the page level
monitoring overhead reduction is the main purpose of this patch, and it makes
sense to me.  Nonetheless, I like this mainly because the perf event could
provide more detailed information including from which CPU/thread the access is
made, and whether the access is for read/write, to my understanding.  Please
let me know if my understanding is wrong.

Thank you so much for sharing these great test results with the detailed setup

Thank you for sharing this, too!

I think we may need to discuss more for final interface.  But I think that
could be done later, after the kerenl ABI is fixed.

The values look bit human-unfriendly.  I wonder if we could use more
human-friendly values, e.g., 'cpu' for type,
'mem_trans_retired.load_latency_gt_1024' for config, etc.  Not necessarily we
need to fix this right now.  Let's keep discussing.

The above information will also be very useful for early testers of this patch
series including myself.  Thank you for sharing.

Again, I like the high level concept of this patch series.  I definitely want
this to be merged.  Nonetheless, not exactly as it is right now.  I think we
should spend enough time for the user interface design.  I hope the final
interface is long-term maintainable and easy to extend.

Thank you for doing this revisioning.

For the user interface and also internal interface, I suggested to consider
reusing those for page fault events based per-CPUs/threads/reads/writes
monitoring DAMON extension patch series in our previous discussion.  I think
this version is following the right direction much more than the previous
version.

But, nowadays I'm thinking about a new user interface for the
per-CPUs/threads/reads/writes monitoring that can easily also extended for perf
event based monitoring and for not only access monitoring but general and
multiple data attributes monitoring.

It is still under the development and I'm planning to share a very early RFC
version of that by LSFMMBPF.  I will try to add my idea about how this perf
event based monitoring could also implemented by reusing the interface on the
early RFC version.

Could we wait until the early RFC version is published, review my idea about
how this perf event based monitoring could reuse it, and continue discussions
about the next steps of this patch series?
