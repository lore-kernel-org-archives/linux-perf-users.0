Thank you for your helpful comments.

Indeed, this patch can be submitted separately.

The purpose of access monitoring with a fixed granularity greater than
the page size is to reduce overhead when the total size of the memory
region being tracked is large.

Also, we want to be able to track hugepage sizes for some targets, so a min=
imum
region size setting is provided for each target.
For example, when memcached is started with the --enable-largepages option,
it will attempt to use THP.

All of the TODOs you suggested are useful.  I will try to share the test
results and comparisons with access bit based cases.

The plan was to start by reusing structures and gradually make use of
infrastructure.  Now, I have a better understanding of your DAMON
extension series
and have no major concerns about migrating to it.

I agree.

Since `perf_event_attr` itself is an argument to the `perf_event_open()` sy=
stem
call, I think future compatibility will be maintained, but I also have some
concerns about whether the interface provided by this patch is optimal.

Also, as mentioned in the TODO section, there are currently almost no
restrictions on the PMUs that can be specified, so it is possible to regist=
er
PMUs that are completely useless for perf event-based access checks.
I have one idea under consideration, and I plan to address it when I send o=
ut
the next patch series.

I'm starting to get a vision of how to incorporate this as sampling primiti=
ves,
but if you try implementing it and share your results, it would be extremel=
y
helpful.

I'm happy with this patch, as it's much simpler than the last one for RFC v=
1.
Next time, I'll send them separately.
