I forgot two other changes:
  - Fixes black c-state drawings in eog and firefox:
    class="rect.cX" is wrong and must be class="cX"
  - Use green color instead of red for idle drawings. This does not clash
    with the Block IO drawings (also red) and better fits the "green IT"
    background the C-states are about :) (that was not really the reason,
    green was one of the last not used colors)...
