It'd be great if we could have something like this.  Currently we have
libperf (in C) in tools/lib/perf but it doesn't have the parser yet.

Anyway there are vendor-contributed event/metric description in JSON
under tools/perf/pmu-events/arch directory.  You may extract the event
encoding from the JSON and convert it using the sysfs format info.

On Alderlake, the 'mem_trans_retired.load_latency_gt_1024' is defined
like below:

tools/perf/pmu-events/arch/x86/alderlake/memory.json +128

    {
        "BriefDescription": "Counts randomly selected loads when the latency from first dispatch to completion is greater than 1024 cycles.",
        "Counter": "1,2,3,4,5,6,7",
        "Data_LA": "1",
        "EventCode": "0xcd",
        "EventName": "MEM_TRANS_RETIRED.LOAD_LATENCY_GT_1024",
        "MSRIndex": "0x3F6",
        "MSRValue": "0x400",
        "PublicDescription": "Counts randomly selected loads when the latency from first dispatch to completion is greater than 1024 cycles.  Reported latency may be longer than just the memory latency.",
        "SampleAfterValue": "53",
        "UMask": "0x1",
        "Unit": "cpu_core"
    },

I think MSRValue is for attr.config1.
