Usually one per CPU cluster/group: in a homogeneous CPU, one instance; in a
CPU with big cores and little cores, there would be two SPE instances; in a
CPU with big, medium and little, three instances. I'm sure it's possible to
come up with more exotic configurations.

The SPE driver supports this partitioning only with device tree, not with
ACPI (for now, there's a series on the mailing list to fix this) and it
looks at the ppi-partitions node to determine which CPUs are associated
with each SPE instance. The node is described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/arm,gic-v3.yaml.

For example, look at arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399-base.dtsi, at the
PMU (not SPE) nodes: there's pmu_a53, associated with ppi_cluster0, which
is interrupt-partition-0, and it includes CPUs cpu_l0 to cpu_l3 (I assume
'l' here stands for 'little'). Then there's also pmu_a72, associated with
ppi_cluster1, which includes CPUs cpu_b0 and cpu_b1 (where 'b' is probably
'big').

If SPE were supported by all the cores, there would have been two
instances: spe_a53, associated with ppi_cluster0, and spe_a72, associated
with ppi_cluster1. If SPE were supported only on the big cores, there would
have been one instance, spe_a72 associated with ppi_cluster1 (naming is
obviously not set in stone, that's just an example).

I think I know what you're going to say and you are right: yes, there are
no device tree files for heterogeneous systems with SPE. Supporting this
type of systems was requested by Will Deacon, the SPE driver maintainer,
because the SPE driver supports them.

All SPE instances are exposed in /sys/bus/event_source/devices. This is an
example for an Orion O6 board (with ACPI and the driver hacked to make it
probe successfully):

$ ls /sys/bus/event_source/devices/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Nov 12  2026 arm_spe_0 -> ../../../devices/platform/arm,spe-v1/arm_spe_0/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Nov 12  2026 armv8_pmuv3_0 -> ../../../devices/armv8_pmuv3_0/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Nov 12  2026 armv8_pmuv3_1 -> ../../../devices/armv8_pmuv3_1/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Nov 12  2026 breakpoint -> ../../../devices/breakpoint/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Nov 12  2026 kprobe -> ../../../devices/kprobe/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Nov 12  2026 software -> ../../../devices/software/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Nov 12  2026 tracepoint -> ../../../devices/tracepoint/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Nov 12  2026 uprobe -> ../../../devices/uprobe/

Notice how there are two PMU instances, but only one SPE instances, that's
because not all CPUs have SPE.

It's up to the user to configure which one the VM uses - see patch #13 in
the series, "KVM: arm64: Add SPE VCPU device attribute to set the SPE
device". As for an example implementation, the user specifies on which
physical CPUs the VM runs, and from there kvmtool finds the SPE instance
that includes those CPUs. See my kvmtool patches [0], namely
spe__init() -> find_pmu() [1] and what find_pmu() does [2].

Having KVM trying to guess what userspace wants sounds frought with danger
to me.

Two different SPE instances cannot be used interchangeably, because A. they
might be totally different implementations (different versions of SPE,
different implemented registers, different events, etc), and even if they
are in theory the same, the events they are recording might have different
semantics across different CPU clusters. For example, Cortex-A53 is in
in-order, Cortex-A72 is out-of-order. How is the guest going to make sense
of any record relating to speculation, and how is the guest going to know
which record was for an instruction sampled on which core?

I think you might have answered that yourself, judging from your subsequent
comments :) Similar to the PMU, KVM will not allow that, and a VCPU will
exit with KVM_EXIT_FAIL_ENTRY if it's scheduled on a physical CPU that is
not part of the cluser that belongs to the SPE instance assigned to the VM.

In general, even if KVM might allow the user to create a VM with VCPUs with
mismatched features, this is not supported and it will almost definitely
blow up at some point. At least, that was the stance of the KVM maintainer
a few years ago, when KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_SET_PMU was added.

I'll add something, because I don't think the dependency is obvious.

I think that's an artifact from an earlier iteration, when it was called
from the hyp object, which is a different namespace than the rest of the
kernel and the __always_inline was required to make sure the function was
copied at the call sites.

I'll remove.

This is the same pattern used for the PMU. Seems like a small thing, so I
think consistency is better? I don't expect more than three SPE instances
in a system (little + medium + big), so the extra 3 * 8 bytes should not be
an issue?

On the other hand, it is indeed more common to embed list_head in struct
arm_spe_pmu. Up to you what you prefer.

Yes, they are equivalent, my bad for not explaining it properly.

I don't think it's something that should cause the probe to fail. I could
add a warning, I guess, to let the user know why KVM_CAP_ARM_SPE is missing
even though the SPE module was loaded successfully.

Hmm... in my head, the _safe variant was always associated with deletion,
and not having the safe variant might cause a bug, if in the future, the
body of the loop is modified and the break removed.

Do you strongly oppose to keeping the safe variant?
