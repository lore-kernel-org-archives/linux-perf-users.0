I think I would interpret it as it is now. Can't the host still use them 
until the guest does and then they only get squeezed if there is a 
collision? That doesn't sound too bad to me. And if a host wants 
reserved counters they can set a positive number.

Is reserved_host_counters==max_counters equivalent to -1? And there's no 
overview in the cover letter or documentation about how it interacts 
with the dynamic guest counter reservations. A bit more detail or a few 
paragraphs in one place would help users, maybe with examples so they 
don't have to piece together all the commit messages to work it out.

People just want it written out fully somewhere so they can copy paste 
it. Kernel developers might be able to piece it together, but not 
everyone will.

The newest Arm FVP should have cpuidle enabled if you boot it with ACPI, 
but I hit this on a Radxa Orion O6 board.

Is that true? The perf core calls perf_pmu_disable() when a process is 
scheduled out before reading the count of each event of that process in 
an inner loop. The perf_pmu_disable() clears PMCR_EL0.E which freezes 
all of the counters so they can be read out in a consistent state.

It's important that they're all stopped at the same time because 
counters might be used in metrics as ratios of each other. So I think 
it's deliberately designed that way and appears to not be working in a 
guest now.

Oh yeah that makes sense, I didn't think about that. I'm not sure if my 
other idea about exception level filtering being responsible makes sense 
either.

If that was the case I would have expected it to be intermittent, or you 
would get a partial count if the second CPU started from 0, but not 
zeros every where every time. Let me know if I can run any more tests.

It doesn't enable any counters though does it, even if it touches some 
of the registers to probe? Should that result in squeezing out host 
counters? Maybe it's more complicated to implement, but right now it 
seems like there is some complexity without much benefit as 90% of hosts 
are going to probe the counters just to see what's there but not use them.
