I'd prefer having single file per parameter, as sysfs is designed for.  It
allows keeping the input format simple and therefore easy to maintain and
extend.  Of course, we should carefult at adding new parameters, though.

Does existing perf event ABI also take that approach?  If so, I think that is
fine.

Thank you for accepting my humble suggestion.  And sorry for making you be
delayed.  Hopefully this interface extension will soon be published as it is
one of the topics for DAMON session [1] at LSFMMBPF.
