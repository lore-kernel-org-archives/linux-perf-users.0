You can lookup 'mem-loads' events on Intel CPUs.  It should be 'cpu',
'cpu_core' and/or 'cpu_atom'.  On AMD, you can use 'ibs_op'.

  $ grep -l . /sys/bus/event_source/devices/*/events/mem-loads
  /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/events/mem-loads

I don't think so.  IIRC it will just have address of 0 if not supported.

No problem!  You may go with the existing vPMU if you just plan to use a
couple of events only.

Thanks,
