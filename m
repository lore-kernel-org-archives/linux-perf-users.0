OK but this is enforced by KVM right? So while it's up to userspace to
ensure affinity, this is checked for and if the user gets it wrong KVM will
bail AFAICT?

So I'd probably add something here about what happens if you don't do this
- i.e. 'this is checked on vCPU load via kvm_arch_vcpu_load(), and if the
CPU does not share the SPE instance specified, KVM will eventually error
out to userspace.'

Hmm this is a nit obviously but this is inconsistent from the previous doc

it :)

With the introduction of kvm_update_supported_cpus() and PMU also using
that, I think you need to add an -EINVAL line to the PMU doc entry too.

Should be KVM_ARM_VCPU_SPE? Looking back I think you also typo'd this in
the previous commit? Very easily done obviously :P

I think you need a paragraph here to explain that you must ensure that
physical CPUs assigned to vCPUs must share the same SPE instance, and
failing to do so will result in KVM returning an error when the vCPU is
attempted to be run.

I think the 'userspace is responsible for making sure that the VCPU is run
only on physical CPUs which share the specified SPE instance' bit can be
hoisted into the suggested paragraph above, leaving this one to focus on
SPE/PMU interactions.

And I think the SPE-specific bit shouldn't mention a similarity to PMU, I
think that's confusing in itself.

> +no physical CPUs which share the same SPE and PMU instance, an error is

This is overall unclear I think. It starts with 'similar to PMU' then
mentions an actual interaction between PMU/SPE. So, as above, I suggest
separating these two out.

And here I think you should be a lot clearer about that PMU/SPE
interaction, something like:

"Both SPE and PMU restrict supported physical CPUs to the subset which
share the selected SPE or PMU instance.

If both are selected, the subsets must overlap, otherwise there would be no
physical CPU on which the vCPUs could run.

If this happens, whichever of KVM_ARM_VCPU_SPE_ID or
KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_SET_PMU specified it returns -EINVAL.

Note that the default PMU selected by KVM is not taken into account by this
check, it only applies when a specific PMU instance has been selected via
KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_SET_PMU."

I feel like 'spe_pmu' as a name is pretty confusing as there is PMU as
regards the perf driver thing, which SPE is implemented as, and also the
general PMUv3 architecture :)

Maybe the _pmu suffix makes sense then on the type (which has to be a
performance monitoring unit driver), but could we replace '_pmu' with
'_instance' in the field, etc. names?

> +};

This looks a little silly as a one field struct, but presumably because you
add more later. I think worth saying so in the commit message?

This naming feels weird, reads to me like 'spe, destroy the vm' which is
probably not the intent :P

Maybe just kvm_spe_destroy()?

This interface is really awkward - it's unclear whether you need to pass
one + other NULL, or both, and what happens in each situation.

And it turns out that actually you should only specify one of them with the
other NULL as it stands.

It seems to me SPE vs. PMU is just immaterial here, and you should simply
have:

int kvm_restrict_supported_cpus(struct kvm *kvm, const cpumask_t *mask)
{
	lockdep_assert_held(&kvm->arch.config_lock);

	if (!cpumask_intersects(kvm->arch.supported_cpus, mask))
		return -EINVAL;

	cpumask_and(kvm->arch.supported_cpus, kvm->arch.supported_cpus, mask);
	return 0;
}

Then all the complexity goes away.

I think it's then simplest to simply disallow re-selection for both SPE and
PMU, returning -EBUSY if they're already selected.

That way it's very clear-cut - you set these once and only once.

You have kvm_spe_pmu_set() already. However that name is also a bit
confusing, since maybe it means 'set it' or refers to its CPU subset or
something. Also I dislike 'pmu' in there as mentioned before.

So that should probably be renamed to kvm_spe_has_instance()?

And to handle the PMU side, introduce KVM_ARCH_FLAG_PMU_SELECTED in
kvm->arch.flags and set this when PMU is selected.

Then add kvm_pmu_has_instance() which tests for this flag.

That way everything is consistent and simple.

I see the bot has already reported about this, but supported_cpus should be
a cpumask_var_t (which is cpumask_t * if CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK, but a
1-element array if not), as zalloc_cpumask_var() accepts a pointer of this
type (cpumask_t ** or cpumask_t (*)[1]).

I think if !CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK that's actually a compile error.

So fix is:

	cpumask_var_t supported_cpus;

But as per above, I think better to just radically simplify this function.

Again the naming bites again here :) kvm_spe_pmu and kvm_pmu are confusing.

Anyway, I think with the suggested changes above we can do away with this
wrapper, like (untested):

Now this does change the semantics - before a VMM could set PMU A, then
change its mind and set PMU B, and on and on as many times as it likes as long
as no event filter was set, with the last one winning.

After this, you set it once.

I don't imagine any VMM is doing or needs to do the former, and if they are
it's a bug really. So I think it's a valid thing to do, and makes
everything consistent.

The SPE side would be easier:

Looks like a stray extra line here?

I guess because you assign ret above (and if non-zero bail) you don't need
to reset here, but probably worth keeping just to be really clear as to
intent?

Does spe_pmus_lock (hopefully spe_instances_lock in future :P) need to be
held over module_put()? Seems unnecessary.

See comments above re: naming.

This !! is unnecessary. The conversion to bool handles it for you.

Obviously similar comments to above about 'spe_pmu' -> 'spe_instance' :)

This really should be -EBUSY for consistency I think.

See above for suggested change to the code for setting up the CPU mask.

You're ignoring the error here, better to do:

	int err;
	...
	err = kvm_spe_update_supported_cpus(kvm, &spe_pmu->supported_cpus);
	if (err) {
		...
		return err;
	}

Assuming you are on board with the suggested rework, I feel like this patch
needs splitting up into:

1. "KVM: arm64: Add helper to restrict a VM's supported CPUs"

Adds the helper, converts SET_PMU, discuss the change in
behaviour. PMU-only, establishes the foundations.

Update PMU doc to reflect new -EINVAL return.

2. "KVM: arm64: Add SPE VCPU device attribute to set the SPE device"

All the SPE bits.

Does that make sense?
