Sounds good.

I'd prefer making DAMON interface as human readable as possible, as long as it
is not duplicating things too much.

I wouldn't mind adding changes that depend on perf user-space tools or
libraries in 'damo' for making it even more human-readable, as long as it
doesn't break the backward compatibility of 'damo', and perf developers are ok
with the perf-side change.  Anyway 'damo' is using 'perf' internally ;)  And
seems perf developers are thankfully very open minded :)


Thanks,
