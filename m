Sorry for the long delay.

I'm afraid you need to deal with PMU hardware details.  For example
PERF_SAMPLE_ADDR may not be available depends on events or sometimes it
may not have valid values in some samples like on AMD IBS.  Also hybrid
CPUs may not have same events on both CPUs.

Maybe it's better to fix which event you want to use on each CPU
architecture.

KVM supports PMU virtualization.  But the existing vPMU support has a
lot of overhead.  Recently mediated vPMU patchset was added so you can
try that instead.  You'll need to pass appropriate options to qemu.
