Argh, forgot guilt refresh on this one.
The changelog could be a bit more detailed by adding:

All features/fixes this patch includes:
  - Read up cpuidle events from sysfs if available
    and thus make them architecture independent
  - Use (free) green color to display idle events in the chart,
    red is also used by "Blocked IO" event(s)
  - Fix wrong class="rect.cX" to class="cX" idle box svg drawing
    definitions. This fixes up black idle drawings for eog (eye of gnome)
    and firefox (inkscape somehow could handle the broken case).
