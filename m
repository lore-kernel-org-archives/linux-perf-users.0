This sounds bit strange to me, because DAMON's upper-bound monitoring overhead
is proportional to the user-set maximum number of regions, not the total
monitoring memory size.

This is again sounds not very completely easy to understand to me, since
adaptive regions adjustment will converge to work in THP granularity in the
case.

Maybe you want to monitor virtual addresses in fixed granularity, but use
different granularity per target?  You could do the fixed granularity
monitoring by setting the min_nr_regions and max_nr_regions same to the total
size of monitoring memory divided by the desired granularity size.  But maybe
this is challenging for your use case, because you use 'vaddr', which
dynamically changes the total monitoring memory size depending on the process's
memory mapping status?

You can also do different granularity monitoring for different virtual address
space by using different DAMON contexts per the target process.  But I guess
you're saying it is not a good user experience?

If so, that makes more sense to me.  But, I think user-space helpers could help
you overhauling the challenges.  I'm curious if you tried that, and found it is
really uncomfortable or too suboptimal.  If so, sharing the experience and/or
test results in more detail will be very helpful.  Maybe we can do this discuss
in more detail on the separated patch, though.

Great.  Nonetheless, I expect you might find devils in the details while coding
it.  Please bear in mind and don't hesitate at asking my help.  I tend to be
wrong a lot and learn from mistakes. :)

I agree to this concern.

Sounds good, looking forward to the next version.

Ok, I will try to make it in a dirty but fast way and share asap, probably
within 2-3 weeks.
