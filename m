Hi Lorenzo,

Many thanks for the stellar review, will start replying soonish.

Like you said, Sean is planning to send my original version of that patch with
an updated commit message, thanks for the ping!

Oliver, some time ago, expressed the opposite preference: VHE-only is OK for an
RFC, but he was concerned about the discrepancy between VHE and nVHE
configurations. Maybe the direction for KVM changed in the meantime.

Fine by me to drop the HACK! patches, of course, that's just something to keep
in mind.

There's plenty of iffiness that userspace already handles when it comes to
virtual machines.

Or, how Oliver put it [1] (regarding migration, but it fits):

'My take is that there's no amount of idiot-proofing we can do in KVM to prevent
the VMM from messing this up somehow'.

I'm not sure that's the best idea. Mainly two reasons:

1. KVM will be imposing the condition that *all* writable memslots be backed by
guest_memfd, and *all* memory backing these memslots be pre-faulted and
effectively pinned.

There are use cases for writable memslots to describe guest memory that won't be
used by SPE. First thing that comes to mind would be paravirtualized interfaces
between host userspace and the guest. For example, pvtime - kvmtool creates a
RAM memslot for pvtime (i.e, non-read-only memslot), and it looks to me that
qemu does the same (but my knowledge of qemu is severely limited, so I might be
completely wrong).

Then there's also the possibility that a guest might want to assign a slice of
RAM for use by SPE, to avoid pre-faulting and pinning the entire VM memory. In
this case, userspace will want to have *only* the memslot describing that slice
pre-faulted and pinned, and not the rest of system memory.

2. Perfomance - userspace can pre-fault in parallel, KVM cannot easily do that.

arm64 now has support for KVM_PRE_FAULT_MEMORY, I say let's use that :)

For background, I started this conversation in the LOG_DIRTY_PAGES support for
guest_memfd series [2]. Oliver had some concerns, but he didn't follow up on my
explanations, so I decided to send migration support as part of SPE so people
can have a more complete picture of how everything fits together.

I would be very happy to get basic support for SPE merged in KVM, and, if we
decide it's useful, migration implemented as a follow up, as that involves
landing dirty page logging support for guest_memfd.

It is intended as a debug/development option, to be used only when the VMs are
trusted. As to why it's there, it's there because without it, SPE would be
disabled on all the machines that I have access to, and I suspect systems not
affected are few and rare between.

I really appreciate your enthusiasm, thanks!
